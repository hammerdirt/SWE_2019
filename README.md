## Solid WasteEngineering 2019

### Semester project

#### Comparing the distribution of object categories identified on Lake Geneva.

1. Sorting by season
2. Sorting by location
3. Identifying plastic types

#### Start in chronological order

If you are new to this start with notebook one. The code used here is simple but effective. Therefore you will need a working knowledge of Python and/or JavaScript to really grasp what is going on.

### Note book one:

__Status:__ Complete => contribute as you like, see guidelines below.

__Set up your environment:__ This is not the place to learn. For data tasks we use Anaconda because it works. The requirements.txt file is included in the repo.

__Getting data:__ Connect the notebook to the API using _requests_ and converting it to python dictionaries.

__Descriptive statistics:__ Use numpy and python dicitionaries to get some basic statistics from the data.

__Plot the data:__ Use matplotlib to plot the data in a time series

### Note book two:

__Status:__ Started => No commits

__Automate:__ Automation of some of the processes in Note book one

__Compare medians:__ Compare the median values of object categories

__Compare medians over time:__ Visualize the survey results grouped by seasons of the year

### Contributing

The purpose of contributing is to present the data according to your understanding of the problem with the following reminders:

1. Be objecitve
2. Know your target group
3. Show value or how to get to value

For students participating in the study you may submit a pull request.  If you are not part of the EPFL group and you would like to contribute contact hammerdirt and lets talk.

__Requirements:__ Analysis must include data from Switzerland and the beach-litter database. Mathematical or statistical processes need to be explained, both in the context of this application and the "general context".

__Packages:__ Please indicate if you are adding packages to the requirements.txt file. That way we can adjust things on our end.

__References:__ Don't forget links to references
